Let's see if we can get there a bit faster, with the power of Recurrent Neural Networks and LSTM.\n",

    "\n",
    "Then, use that trained RNN to generate Shakespearean-ish text. Your goal - a function that can take, as an argument, the size of text (e.g. number of characters or lines) to generate, and returns generated text of that size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note - Shakespeare wrote an awful lot. It's OK, especially initially, to sample/use smaller data and parameters, so you can have a tighter feedback loop when you're trying to get things running. Then, once you've got a proof of concept - start pushing it more!"

    "- Refine the training and generation of text to be able to ask for different genres/styles of Shakespearean text (e.g. plays versus sonnets)\n",
    "- Train a classification model that takes text and returns which work of Shakespeare it is most likely to be from\n",
    "- Make it more performant! Many possible routes here - lean on Keras, optimize the code, and/or use more resources (AWS, etc.)\n",
